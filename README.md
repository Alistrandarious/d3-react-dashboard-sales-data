This project was created as part of an interview with Primer.

I have created a single page web application that can be explored. The repo hasn't been ran as a distribution pack and will run with #npm start.

My file structure follows a simple layout. I do have a folder dedicated to data, where I have used Python Pandas to aggregate the data into small dataframes to be used in loading visuals.

Visualizations folder has CountriesAndRegions, and TrendsOverTime. CountriesAndRegions is a standalone visual folder, they aren't built in the same way as TrendsOverTime. TrendsOverTime is built as functions where parametres are passed through.

This is a single page React Application with Bootstrap, creating d3 visuals.
