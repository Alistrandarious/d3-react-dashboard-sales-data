        The data that I have had access to was for August in 2021 for an
        anonymous retailer. I did investigate categories, response time, and
        other views. However, for the purposes of Primer, in generating further
        revenue (based on a 1% transaction fee business model), I have come up
        with two key Analyses.
        <br />
        <br />
        Let's suggest that this report can be shared with the anonymous
        retailer; and offer analytics to the client that strengthen both of our
        financial interests. For this particular retailer; which markets should
        be focused on - and which time intervals can we benefit from. Europe is
        a key region - with both the highest amount of transactions being found
        in Sweden, and the highest amount of revenue generated (by a large
        margin) is in the UK. It appears that the weekend, particularly
        saturday, is a great day for the business - with transactions and value
        typically dropping mid week. What is interesting in the latter case, is
        that it was uncovered that offering more payment options results in an
        increase in site expenditure - opening up to a new customer base. This
        shows the value of Primer as a service, and positions itself well in an
        economy where buying decisions can be fractionalized over a period of
        time.
