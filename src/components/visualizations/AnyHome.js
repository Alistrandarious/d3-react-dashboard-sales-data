        Hi Aaron! <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alis/">Ali Shah</a> here.
        I've spent the last week building you an application to showcase my
        skills as a visualizer. I have analysed the data to draw insights and
        showcase them to you within an React Carousel. The links in the Nav Bar
        above will take you through some of the stories I found within the data,
        and the Analysis overview tab will document my research and findings,
        bringing them back to Primer. 
        <br />
        <br />
        This has all been done in a week. I've
        highly enjoyed the project. I hope you enjoy my findings. Here are some
        of the things I'd like to show you as result of my work.
        <ul>
          <li>Analysis and storytelling.</li>
          <li>One-off visuals and unique data views.</li>
          <li>Component-based visuals.</li>
          <li>Working knowledge of react.</li>
          <li>A strong passion for Data Visualization.</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        If the project was longer, I would have liked to build upon it further.
        Some things I'd have liked to have added consist of:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Increased interactivity through data switches and update functions
            wrapped around my charts. I really focused on the creativity and
            story; but I realize some functionality would really make it pop.
          </li>
          <li>
            A dashboard that allows you to comb through and click into the data
            in different ways. I think that's the main thing my project lacked.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
